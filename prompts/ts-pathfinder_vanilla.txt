Build a grid-based pathfinding library and visualizer CLI in TypeScript.

Requirements:
- Grid representation:
  - 2D grid with configurable dimensions (up to 1000x1000)
  - Cell types: empty (passable), wall (impassable), weighted (cost 1-9), start, goal
  - Load grids from text files (. = empty, # = wall, 1-9 = weighted, S = start, G = goal)
  - Generate random mazes using recursive backtracking or Prim's algorithm
- Pathfinding algorithms (implement ALL of these):
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search) — unweighted shortest path
  - Dijkstra — weighted shortest path
  - A* with Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics — heuristic-guided search
  - Bidirectional BFS — search from both ends
  - Jump Point Search (JPS) — optimized A* for uniform grids
- Comparison mode:
  - Run all algorithms on the same grid
  - Report for each: path length, path cost, nodes explored, time taken (ms)
  - Rank algorithms by efficiency (nodes explored) and speed
- Batch benchmarking:
  - Generate N random grids of given dimensions
  - Run all algorithms on each, compute average statistics
  - Output summary table comparing algorithms
- CLI interface:
  - `pathfind solve <grid_file>` — solve and display path
  - `pathfind compare <grid_file>` — compare all algorithms
  - `pathfind bench --size 100 --count 50` — benchmark on random grids
  - `pathfind generate --size 50 --density 0.3` — generate random grid
- Output formats: text (ASCII grid with path marked), JSON (full stats)

Technical requirements:
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Node.js compatible (no browser dependencies)
- Build with tsconfig.json (target ES2020+)
- Clean module separation: grid, algorithms/, heuristics, maze_generator, cli, benchmark
- Priority queue implementation (binary heap) — do NOT use array.sort() for the open set
- Unit tests using Vitest or Jest
- Include benchmark results in README
- Include a README with build and usage instructions
